 
**The problem we are trying to solve:** People want to know which music to seek out and avoid, without having to listen to it; they need reviews from experts in order to determine this.
- The first type of user would be a reviewer, who writes about music. The reviewer wants:
	1. to have many people read their reviews, and - 
	2. for people to open their profile to read their work on other publications.
- The second type of user would be a consumer, who reads about music. The consumer wants:
	1. to find reviews about music they are interested in buying/listening to	
	2. to explore the new kinds of music they might like 
 
**The overall strategy of how we intend to solve the problem:** We plan to create a website where reviewers can post reviews about music for consumers to peruse. The reviews will be classified and sorted. Users can search for their desired data on our website. 
 
**A brief description of the Web API we intend to use**
- Genius API: https://docs.genius.com/
- Allows retrieving songs, annotations, etc as well as account related information
- The ability to get annotations will be useful, because reviewers can use annotations (explanations about lyrics) to supplement their reviews
- Retrieving specific songs/artists can also be useful because it will allow us to provide consumers with information outside of reviews
